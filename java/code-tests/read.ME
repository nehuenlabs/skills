## Palindrome
This example shows how to determine wether a given word is palindrome or not.
The code receives a word in char array format.

### Big-O: Time Complexity
This code is O(n) time complexity because it depends on the given word length.
So the 'n' represents the length of the char array.

### Big-O: Space Complexity
This code is O(1) Space Complexity which means the required memory space for its
execution will does not depend on the given word length.
